ABC is a right triangle, 90°at B.
Therefore, ABC = 90
Point M is the midpoint of hypotenuse AC.
You are given the lengths AB and BC.
Your task is to find MBC in degrees.

Input Format

The first line contains the length of side AB.
The second line contains the length of side BC.

Output Format

Output MBC in degrees.

Note: Round the angle to the nearest integer.
If angle is 56.5000001°, then output 57°.
If angle is 56.5000000°, then output 57°.
